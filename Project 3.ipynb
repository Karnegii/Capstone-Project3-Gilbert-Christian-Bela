    "**Background** \n",
    "   \n",
    "Term deposit products play a critical role in supporting the bank’s funding stability. Each year, marketing campaigns are conducted through telemarketing to acquire new customers. However, historical performance shows that mass outreach is becoming increasingly inefficient: response rates are declining, operational costs are rising, and traditional segmentation methods are no longer sufficient to capture the complexity of customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the telemarketing industry, the cost per calls varies but with campaign volumes reaching tens of thousands of calls, inaccurate targeting can lead to operational losses reaching tens or even hundreds of millions of rupiah in a single campaign cycle. Beyond financial implications, repeated contact with low-potential customers increases the risk of customer fatigue, potentially affecting overall brand perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical campaign data indicates that a customer’s likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit is influenced by multiple interacting factors—financial profile, loan history, communication preferences, and previous campaign outcomes. This complexity requires a more precise, data-driven approach rather than intuition-based or manual segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these challenges, the development of a Machine Learning model becomes a strategic and urgent initiative. By predicting subscription probability at the individual customer level, such a model can:\n",
    "- Reduce campaign costs\n",
    "- Improve targeting accuracy\n",
    "- Optimize the productivity of marketing and sales teams\n",
    "- Direct promotional efforts toward high-potential customer segments  \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing a predictive model is not simply a technological enhancement; it is a strategic investment that strengthens marketing effectiveness, increases deposit acquisition, and supports the bank’s long-term growth objectives."

    "**Term Deposit Definition**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Term deposit is a financial product offered by banks which mechanism is that a customer deposits a sum of money at the bank which can only be withdrawn after a certain period of time. As compensation, customers will be given a fixed interest according to the nominal amount of money deposited. In this case, the bank is trying to acquire new customers through a telemarketing campaign. \n",
    "  \n",
    "The amount of money required to subscribe to a term deposit product varies from bank to bank. Permata Bank, for example, offers a term deposit with the minimum deposit of 10 million rupiahs while BCA and BTN offer a minimum deposits of 8 million and 5 million rupiahs respectively. With no context on how much money is required for a term deposit in our case, we could take the numbers before and put an estimate between **5-10 million rupiahs** as a minimum amount that each customer would have to deposit."

    "- The sales department, who could save cost, time, and effort by prioritizing customers with high subscription probability.\n",

    "- False Positive : Prediction says the potential customer would subscribe but actually they wouldn't. This failure could cause a waste of marketing budget, time, and effort. As for the loss, it is hard to pinpoint a specific number as it depends on how the bank runs its telemarketing (in-house vs outsourcing, length of call, other included costs (monitoring, training, follow-ups, retries), etc.). But as a baseline, we could set an estimate of **IDR 1000 to IDR 2000** for each call and **IDR 20.000 to IDR 40.000** for each qualified lead (successful deposit-interest, appointment set, etc.) which are lengthier and more numerous calls.

    "Random Forest Model is a machine learning model that helps predict something by combining the results of many Decision Trees. The process was done by bootstrap aggregating (bagging) bunch of Decision Trees model with using random feature selection on each split and then taking the majority vote of the results as the final outcome. The prediction given by Random Forest Model should be better than a singular Decision Trees as it is equivalent to asking many experts to vote on a single conclusion rather than asking only one expert to produce the conclusion. The model also has an advantage in interpretability as it also provides feature importances that could be used as additional insights."

Secondly, the dataset used in the model only has limited range in value (such as balance) which might be different in the newer data. Lastly, the parameters used in making the algorithm was tuned so that the computing time doesn't take too long which might cause some inaccuracy."
